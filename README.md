# ResilientDB: A High-throughput yielding Permissioned Blockchain Fabric.

### ResilientDB aims at *Making Permissioned Blockchain Systems Fast Again*. ResilientDB makes *system-centric* design decisions by adopting a *multi-thread architecture* that encompasses *deep-pipelines*. Further, we *separate* ordering of client transactions from their execution, which allows us to do *out-of-order processing of messages*.
